# Calico Open Field Video Analysis
This repository contains the code base for Calico's implementation of the open field assay, which is compatible with mice
of varying coat colors.  It also includes instructions for building an open field system that will be compatible with this
software, as well as an overview of the in vivo protocol focusing aspects that are important for successful data analysis.
